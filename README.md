# 🚀 Dart Basics - Learn Dart Programming from Zero!

Welcome to **Dart Basics** - a beginner-friendly repository to learn Dart programming from scratch! This repository is designed for people with **zero programming knowledge** who want to learn Dart and eventually build Flutter apps.

## 🎯 What is Dart?

Dart is a programming language created by Google. It's used to build:
- **Mobile apps** (with Flutter)
- **Web apps**
- **Desktop apps**
- **Server applications**

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This repository contains **6 simple examples** that teach you the basics:

### 1. 📝 **Basic Data Types** (`01_basic_data_types.dart`)
- Text (String) - names, messages
- Numbers (int, double) - age, height, price
- True/False (bool) - yes/no questions
- Smart variables (var, final, const)

### 2. 🔧 **Functions** (`02_functions.dart`)
- What functions are and why we use them
- How to create simple functions
- Functions that give us information back
- Functions that do math for us

### 3. 📦 **Collections** (`03_collections.dart`)
- Lists - like a shopping list
- Sets - unique items only
- Maps - like a phone book with names and numbers

### 4. 🏗️ **Classes and Objects** (`04_classes_objects.dart`)
- What classes are (like blueprints)
- How to create objects
- Different ways to create objects
- One class using another (inheritance)

### 5. 🎲 **Enums and Null Safety** (`05_enums_null_safety.dart`)
- Enums - like a menu with limited choices
- Null safety - preventing crashes
- Late variables - setting values later
- Smart operators for handling empty values

### 6. 🎮 **Control Flow** (`06_control_flow.dart`)
- If-else statements - making decisions
- Switch statements - multiple choices
- Loops - repeating things
- Break and continue - controlling loops

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Prerequisites
- **No programming experience needed!** 🎉
- Just install Dart on your computer

### Installation

1. **Download Dart SDK** from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

   ```

### Running the Examples

1. **Download** this repository
2. **Open terminal/command prompt** in the repository folder
3. **Run individual examples**:
   ```bash
   dart 01_basic_data_types.dart
   dart 02_functions.dart
   dart 03_collections.dart
   dart 04_classes_objects.dart
   dart 05_enums_null_safety.dart
   dart 06_control_flow.dart
   ```

4. **Or run all examples** at once:
